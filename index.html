                <h1>HELLO THERE!</h1>As you may have noticed by now, my name is Sara and I am a self-taught programmer
                and UI designer. My experience so far is focused on front-end but my end-goal is to become a full stack developer. 
                I am passionate about programming and self improvement in general and I love to explore how I can write cleaner and more efficient code.
                Feel free to check out some examples of my programming and design projects below.

                <p>I created this web app using React,
                    Typescript and SASS. I designed the UI and wrote the code except credit to <a

                        target="_blank">Dan Abramov</a> for the "Use Interval" react hook. You can check out my code <a

                <p>This is a free native IOS app that I designed and
                    programmed using Swift in Xcode. Due to the yearly cost of an Apple Developer license, my husband
                    and I share the account under his name. You can download it for free from the App Store <a

                <p>I worked on the design for
                    this mobile app under Devsword, a small personal business and side project. My personal input was
                    concept development, UX and UI design.</p>

                <p>This app is
                    just a concept at this point. A sequel to the original app, Scrappy Stories 2 is a re-skin of the
                    original app with a fresh new design.</p>

                <p>I
                    designed the UX and UI for this app for a client of Devsword.</p>

                    Scrappy Stories is a mobile game which I worked on the design for. This image is an example of a
                    responsive marketing website design which I came up with when the app was first released.</p>
